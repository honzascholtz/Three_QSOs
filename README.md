All the data and products are available to download at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K2Fnd-H_8nu-SKr84noMplyia3TXRl-B?usp=sharing. 

Please download the whole package and change the MyPATH in Tools_path.py to point to the folder containing the code and Works_folder. 

I have included all the by-products so you can run any scripts and it should generate the figure in the paper. If you would like to start from scratch, please run the script in the order they are named. This will allow to create all the products necessary to plot the paper figures. 

This code has been tested on Python 3.7, numpy 1.15.3, scipy 1.2.1. Preliminary testing suggested that the code will NOT work with numpy 1.16.0 or latee.
